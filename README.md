## Technologies and Methodologies


## Running the Project

To run the project, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using Xcode (macOS only)

1. **Xcode**: Install the latest version of Xcode to build and run the application.
2. **macOS**: Ensure your Mac is running a recent version of macOS that supports the latest Swift, SwiftUI and SpriteKit features.

### Option 2: Installing from IPA File using AltStore (works on macOS and Windows)

Alternatively, you can install the app using an IPA file. Follow these steps to install the IPA file using AltStore:

   1. Go to the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/AppleFoundationTurns/Turns/releases).
   2. Download the IPA file to your computer.
   3. Download and install AltStore on your computer from [altstore.io](https://altstore.io).
   4. Open AltStore and connect your iOS device to your computer.
   5. Go to the “My Apps” tab in AltStore.
   6. Click the "+" button and select the downloaded IPA file.
   7. Enter your Apple ID and password if prompted.
   8. The app will be installed on your device.
   9. Navigate to "General" -> "Device Management" (or "Profiles & Device Management").
   10. Find the profile for the app you just installed and trust it.
   11. Now you can run the app from your device's home screen!

By following these steps, you can install the app using the IPA file with AltStore on your iOS device. This method is useful if you do not have a Mac or prefer not to build the app from Xcode directly.
