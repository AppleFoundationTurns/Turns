Turns is an engaging and cooperative platformer game developed in Swift as the Final Project for the "Apple Foundation Program 2024" at the University of Palermo. Inspired by the excitement of playing video games with friends during childhood, it allows two players to take turns controlling their characters, each with unique abilities, to navigate through levels and reach the goal. The game features a strategic "Turn" button to switch control between players, emphasizing teamwork and coordination.

## Features

- **Cooperative Gameplay**: Players control two different characters, each with distinct abilities, and must work together to reach the end of the level.
- **Unique Turn Mechanic**: Players alternate control by pressing the "Turn" button, switching visibility and control between the two.
- **Single Tutorial Level**: A tutorial level helps players understand the game's mechanics and how to utilize the turn-based cooperation effectively.
- **Custom Assets**: All assets, including the logo, sprites, and music, are either created from scratch or sourced from free-to-use, non-copyrighted materials.

## Technologies and Methodologies

## Running the Project

To run the project, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using Xcode (macOS only)

1. **Xcode**: Install the latest version of Xcode to build and run the application.
2. **macOS**: Ensure your Mac is running a recent version of macOS that supports the latest Swift, SwiftUI and SpriteKit features.

### Option 2: Installing from IPA File using AltStore (works on macOS and Windows)

Alternatively, you can install the app using an IPA file. Follow these steps to install the IPA file using AltStore:

   1. Go to the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/AppleFoundationTurns/Turns/releases).
   2. Download the IPA file to your computer.
   3. Download and install AltStore on your computer from [altstore.io](https://altstore.io).
   4. Open AltStore and connect your iOS device to your computer.
   5. Go to the “My Apps” tab in AltStore.
   6. Click the "+" button and select the downloaded IPA file.
   7. Enter your Apple ID and password if prompted.
   8. The app will be installed on your device.
   9. Navigate to "General" -> "Device Management" (or "Profiles & Device Management").
   10. Find the profile for the app you just installed and trust it.
   11. Now you can run the app from your device's home screen!

By following these steps, you can install the app using the IPA file with AltStore on your iOS device. This method is useful if you do not have a Mac or prefer not to build the app from Xcode directly.

## Conclusion

Through the development of Turns, we learned valuable lessons in cooperative game design and the implementation of unique gameplay mechanics. The project enhanced our skills in Swift programming and game development with SpriteKit. We also acquired hands-on experience with multiplayer functionality using Multipeer Connectivity and mastered the MVVM design pattern, which improved our ability to build modular and maintainable codebases. Overall, creating Turns was an enriching experience that deepened our understanding of game development and collaborative programming.
